            <p>People always ask<span class="spn">
                    B &amp;
                    B</span>In the end what is it? In fact, there are a lot of things that are not easy to define.
                China's B &amp; B is definitely one. Full of feelings of B &amp; B can quickly ignite you. When writing
                articles about homestay feelings, I always like to use the sentence pattern "he quit his job as a senior
                manager of a foreign enterprise and came to live in seclusion in the mountains". Maybe every scholar
                will have a dream of a paradise in his heart. But can modern people really go back to Taoyuan?
            </p>
            <p>The target customers of B &amp; B should be the post-80s and 90s generation, who advocate freedom and are
                more curious. You can be in a daze in the B &amp; B, aimless, or chat with the shop owner.<span
                    class="spn">For them, travel is a kind of relaxation, which is to escape the tense life of the city
                    and get a real relaxation; travel is also to experience the local characteristics and feel a way of
                    life that has never been before.</span>
            </p>

            <p>Compared with a luxury hotel, it is more difficult for tourists to resist the temptation of a unique
                boutique B &amp; B. For tourists, it seems to be more emotional and more likely to affect each other's
                feelings. For example, it is a kind of warmth of home, a kind of kindness of returning to the hometown,
                a kind of purity of embracing nature, a kind of beauty of loving life, and a kind of moving of
                persistent dream
            </p>
            <p>A good B &amp; B<span class="spn">Not only can it provide a comfortable living environment, but also can
                    have emotional resonance with tourists</span>。Compared with a luxury hotel, it is more difficult for

                    impressive.</span></p>
            <p>The reason why B &amp; B attracts tourists mainly lies in its "non-standard" nature. People want to feel
                the unique local culture and local flavor through B &amp; B, so we should avoid stylization. Tourists
                should live in and naturally become a part of the local cultural environment.
                In a word, B &amp; B is an exquisite industry. Tourists need to have a better understanding of the
                surrounding regional environment through B &amp; B as a carrier, so it must not be large-scale and
                clustered。</p>
